## The purpose of the application.
This aplication is made for companies to post products on facebook, instagram
and its official platform all at once. 
Also we are able to see comments from both platforms on our application.
## How was this app made?
This app is made with the help of facebbok's graphAPI.
It uses MVC framework, mongoDB , express, Node.JS and its design is
a free online design modified to match my needs.
## Why was this app made?
This app was made for a competition named CodeJam.
## Cons of this application
To actually use the application post functionality you need to
have Facebook permission to use its API and to have that permission
you need to have paperwork which I dont have. 
I had the option to generate a access token which would expire one hour after
it has been generated by the time I developed the app and that is why
the application can't have the full functionality while hosted on heroku.
However, you can see the already posted products.
